Book Management System

This is a simple Python project I made. It runs in the terminal and helps to manage books.
What it does:

Add a book (title, author, year)

Show all books

Search a book by title

Delete a book

Exit the program

How to run:

Just open the Python file and run it using any Python 3 version.
You can use:

python book_management.py

Note:
        This is a basic project for practice. I may add more features later.

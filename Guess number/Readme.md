Guessing Number Game

This is a fun Python game I made where you have to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
How it works:

    The computer picks a number randomly.

    You try to guess it.

    It tells you if your guess is too high or too low.

    It shows how many tries you took when you guess right.

    After winning, you can play again if you want.

How to run:
    Just run the Python file with:

python guessing_game.py

Note:

This is a basic game for practice and fun. More features can be added later.

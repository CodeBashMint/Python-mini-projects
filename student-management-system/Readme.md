Student Management Program

This is a basic Python project I made to manage student records using the terminal.
What it does:

Add new student (name, age, city)

Show all students

Search student by name

Update student info

Remove a student

Exit the program


How to run:
        Just run the Python file using any Python 3 version:

python student_management.py

📝 Note:

This is a simple CLI project for practice and learning. I may improve it later.
